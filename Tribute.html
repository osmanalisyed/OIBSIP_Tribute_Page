    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was an Indian lawyer, politician,
    and social activist. He played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence from British rule,
    employing nonviolent civil disobedience as his primary weapon.

    Gandhi is best remembered for his leadership during the Salt March in 1930, where he and thousands
    of followers marched over 240 miles to protest the British monopoly on salt production in India.
    His philosophy of Satyagraha (truth-force) and Ahimsa (nonviolence) inspired millions around the world
    and continues to be influential in the realm of peaceful resistance movements.

    Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, Gandhi dedicated his life to advocating for
    the rights of the oppressed, fighting against discrimination, and promoting harmony among diverse communities.
    He was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy as the Father of the Nation lives on.
